# Hypergeometric2F1
A simple Mathematica package that implements solutions of the hypergeometric equation, their connection formulas and information regarding their domain of validity and equivalences. These expressions can be found in several textbooks and also online. The reason why I implemented this was not just to have the crude expression, but mainly to be able to access information regarding the sector of the complex plane where each function is analytic, where is its branch cut, and to be able to move the branch cut, by multiplying each solution by a constant, in a such a way that I still had 4 equivalent solutions.
